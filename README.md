## Flux Comment

This is an example app built with the Flux pattern. It's really a broken down re-write of the [Flux Chat](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat) example.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

This will make webpack watch the project and build a new bundle on each change. It also starts python server.

`localhost:8000`
